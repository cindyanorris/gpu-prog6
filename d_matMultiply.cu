    This function prepares and invokes a kernel to perform

    Inputs:
    matrixM - points to matrixM data
    matrixN - points to matrixN data
    result - points to the matrix to hold the result
    width - width and height of the input and result matrices
    which - indicates which kernel to use (SIMPLE, TILED, TILED2)
